<p> In todayâ€™s post, we are covering the topic of Gaze Estimation and Tracking.

I was invited to give a talk on the subject at a workshop on Eye Tracking for AR and VR organized by Facebook Research at the International Conference on Computer Vision (2019).

The slides are from that talk.

This post is for absolute beginners. We explain the problem of gaze estimation, current methods for collecting ground truth data, public datasets, and current methods for solving the gaze estimation/tracking problem. All the information is contained in the video. The text below simply links to some of the material presented above.

Simply put, in gaze estimation / tracking, we want to find where a person is looking.

There are two setup

1. Screen Based (or Remote ) Gaze Tracking
2. Gaze Tracking in Wearable Devices </P>
